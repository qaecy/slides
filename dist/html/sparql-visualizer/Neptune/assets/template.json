            "description": "This is a simple app to visualize and communicate the content of a knowledge base in the RDF format. The project is open source, and we welcome all who is interested to participate. Please find the Github repository [here](https://github.com/MadsHolten/sparql-visualizer).\n\nThe frontend of the app is based on [Angular](https://angular.io/), [material design](https://material.angular.io/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/) and the default local triplestore is based on [rdfstore](https://github.com/antoniogarrote/rdfstore-js). Since rdfstore does not fully support SPARQL 1.1 and has no reasoning capabilities, it is recomended to use a [Stardog](https://www.stardog.com/) based triplestore instead.\n### Use a Stardog triplestore\nTo use the app with a Stardog triplestore this sparql-visualizer app must either be available online, or it must run in a local environment. You can find the instructions for installing a local version of this app under [Detailed installation guide](https://github.com/MadsHolten/sparql-visualizer)\nWith a local copy of the app running, make sure you have a Stardog running (defaults to port 5820) with an empty database (let's call it 'test'), so that you don't delete anything important. Then click the \"Switch to triplestore\" button and type in \"http://localhost:5820\" as endpoint and \"test\" as database. If you haven't changed the username and password they both default to \"admin\".\n### Use the default local triplestore\nThis will work, but beware that some queries will not run properly, and INSERT/DELETE will not be possible.\n### Resources\n*[Documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)\n\n*[Online course in Linked Data Engineering](https://open.hpi.de/courses/semanticweb2016)",

            "description": "This is a simple dataset for you to get started with. Extend it and add it as a new tab by following these instructions:\n\n### Here in SPARQL visualizer\n\n1) Add some more data to the graph\n\n2) Change the description (The editor supports [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet))\n\n3) Copy the dataset to clipboard\n\n![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-EniSmGCTypfjMtdp9_-IwMhEJvWJeV4 \"Do adjustments and copy data\")\n\n### In template JSON-file [(Get it here)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadsHolten/sparql-visualizer/gh-pages/assets/template.json)\nOpen the file in your preferred text editor. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is awesome, but Notepad will do. Then continue with these steps:\n\n4) Change the title of the document and add your name(s)\n\n5) Paste in the JSON object (which you should have at your clipboard from *step 3)*)\n\n6) Change the title of the new tab you just added.\n\n![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nCwSKGeU9rkV-XJVRcYyxZUxP6eGayto \"Edit template JSON file\")\n\n### Re-configure SPARQL-visualizer\nInstead of using the default file, SPARQL-visualizer should use the JSON-file you just configured. This is done by adding (or changing) the `file` URL parameter in the address bar so it looks like this:\n\n`https://madsholten.github.io/sparql-visualizer?file=<PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE>`\n\n`<PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE>` is the path to the JSON-file, and as it must be publicly available there are a few options. The easy one is to just add it to your private Dropbox and create a shared link to the file. When working in a Dropbox directory this is as easy as right-clicking the file and choosing `Copy Dropbox Link`. This will establish a direct link so changes in the file will be directly reflected in the visualizer when refreshing the browser view.\n\nAlternatively, the content of the JSON-file can be copied to a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Just provide a file name and create a secret or public gist. SPARQL-visualizer needs the raw file, so in the next window, click the *Raw* button. The URL of the raw page can be used as value for `<PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE>`."
