              QAECY was founded by Philipp, Manos and me. I met Philipp at a bSI
              Summit in Paris in 2018 (or London 2018 - hard to remember).<br /><br />
              I met Manos in 2019 at LDAC Lisbon.<br /><br />
              When I was at NIRAS we finally got the chance to do a project
              together for a danish ofshore wind farm company. That involved
              developing a minimal PoC that we are now turning into a
              product.<br /><br />
              We have quite different competences that compliment each other
              well.

              We do store data in document management systems and assign
              metadata like revision letters, but often there are duplicates of
              a file and metadata might not be up to date.<br /><br />
              Some files are even scanned copies that are not searchable. And
              even if they are, it typically requires an expert to read through

              In SPARQL language, the query looks like this and here I will
              execute it on the actual DBPedia live.<br /><br />
              You see how fast it is even with 9,5 billion triples?<br /><br />
              Therefore: Capture as much information about your real estate
              assets as possible. Size is not a limitation!<br /><br />
              You hopefully also see how versatile this data structure is. I
              don't imagine anyone considering this query when originally
              building the data structure - this is vastly different from the

              This is an example from our product where the question is mapped
              to a query on the graph.<br /><br />
              One interesting thing to note here is the fact that it doesn't
              matter in what BIM model the information is. The slabs and
              mechanical elements are in two different models but can be viewed
              together. The graph allows us to have a higher abstraction
              layer<br /><br />
              We also support that the same geometry can have multiple
              geometrical representations. 2D, 3D, Point cloud, BIM etc.
