              The reason why these are not
              <strong>Canonical Entities</strong> is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BIM objects are duplicated

              Most <strong>Canonical Entities</strong> in our pipelines are created by AI but it
              is also possible to define
              <strong>Explicit Canonical Entities</strong> in a project.
