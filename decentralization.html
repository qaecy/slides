				<h4>How we deal with it</h4>
			</section>

			<section>
				At <img src="dist/img/logo.svg" class="inline-logo" /> we distinguish between the <strong>File</strong> and its <strong>Content</strong>.
			</section>

			<section>
				The <strong>Content nodes</strong> and <strong>File nodes</strong> are represented in a knowledge graph
			</section>

			<section data-background-iframe="dist/html/cytoscape/file-content-1.html"></section>

			<section data-background-image="dist/img/misc/file_dms.svg" data-background-size="80%">
				<p>So how would we represent this?</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>We use a hashing mechanism so the same content will always translate to the same unique id</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<img src="dist/img//misc/hashing.png" alt="">
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>We can use this technique to always create the same id when we wish it to be so and in contrast create a new id when this is desired</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>The <strong>file id</strong> is generated from a combination of what system it is stored on and what is it's path</p>
				<p class="fragment">The <strong>content id</strong> is generated from the file content</p>
			</section>

			<section data-background-iframe="dist/html/cytoscape/file-content-2.html"></section>

			<section>
				<p>This approach is completely flexible</p>
				<p class="fragment">One file can point to several content nodes (different versions) even though its name hasn't changed.</p>
				<p class="fragment">One content node can point to several cloud locations - one for each file.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>So now we can deal with multiple representations of the same file. But what about the relationships between the individual content nodes?</p>
			</section>

		</section>

		<section>

			<section>
				<h4>Document fragments</h4>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>The content node is the most overall representation of a document</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>The any subset of a document is referred to as a <strong>Fragment</strong> and those can have sub-fragments in any arbitrary depth</p>
			</section>

			<section data-background-iframe="dist/html/cytoscape/document-fragments.html"></section>

			<section>
				<p>Information such as the page number or the fragment's position relative to its parent can be expressed as properties on the individual fragments</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>A BIM Model is not any different</p>
			</section>

			<section data-background-iframe="dist/html/cytoscape/document-fragments-bim-1.html"></section>

			<section data-background-iframe="dist/html/cytoscape/document-fragments-bim-2.html"></section>

			<section>
				<p>The same goes for a CAD document, an e-mail, an image etc.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>In the BIM model already encapsulates a lot of contextural information like relationships between zones, elements etc.</p>
				<p class="fragment">But how about when an object in one model has a relationship to an object in another model?</p>
				<p class="fragment">Or when there are duplicate representations of the same object across models</p>
				<p class="fragment">Or when there is a reference between a BIM object and some other document like an image or an e-mail?</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>This can all be represented in the knowledge graph!</p>
